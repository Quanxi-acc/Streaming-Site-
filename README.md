# Streaming Site Project (BTS SIO - 1st Year)

## Description

This project is a local replica of a streaming website, developed as part of my **BTS SIO (1st year)** studies. It will not be published online and is intended solely as a learning experience.

## Features

### General features for *users*:

Users can create an account and log in through two separate pages.

Once logged in, users can:

* Browse interactively through carousels displaying movies and series.
* Movies and series are categorized by genre or type, allowing users to filter or search easily.
* Create an account through the "My Account" page.
* Use an interactive search bar.
* Watch trailers for each movie.
* A verification system ensures each email is unique.
* Mobile compatibility.

### General features for *administrators*:

Administrators have access to a management panel that allows them to:

* Add genres, types, actors, and directors, in order to later add a movie to the database and integrate it directly into the website.

## Future Objectives

* A "Modify" button to update information about existing items (movies/series).
* Duplicate prevention (e.g., prevents adding existing movies, with a red alert).
* A verification system ensures each email is unique. Duplicates trigger a red error message.
* Alert during account creation: duplicate emails display a red warning.
* Full admin panel: add a "Modify" button and prevent duplicates.
* Display red warning on the registration page for duplicate emails.

## Known Bugs

* Profile fix: Make sure each profile click properly updates the session.
* Home, Movies, and Series buttons overlay the movie trailer.

## Technologies Used

* List of technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL.
